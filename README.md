pnglish
=======

This is a pet project that I worked on four years ago before I had even heard of OOP. It's a basic compiler that converts "PNGlish" to PHP code.

There is no gaurentee any of this will work, it's provided for your amusement.

### Note

The function `function createTextAreaWithLines(id)` in the JS is _not_ mine. I have no idea where I got it from. If someone drops me a link or info I'll be happy to acredit the orrignal author.
